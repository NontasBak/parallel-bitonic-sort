\section{Objective}
Sorting algorithms usually take $O(nlogn)$ time to sort an array of size n. Bitonic sort is a parallel sorting 
algorithm that can sort very large arrays faster with the power of MPI and parallel processing. In this report, 
we will present the implementation of this algorithm. We will also present the results of our experiments 
and compare the different benchmarks.

\section{Algorithm Analysis}

\subsection{Overview}

Before the algoirithm runs, the user must specify the number of elements and processes.
Let $p = 2^k$ be the number of processes where $k = [1:7]$ and $2^q$ the number of elements in each process
where $q = [20:27]$. Our goal is to sort an array of size $p * 2^q$.

\subsection{Parallelism - MPI}

The algorithm will follow the standard \textbf{Bitonic Sort Network} pattern as shown in Figure \ref{fig:bitonic-sort-network}.
Our goal is to create bitonic sequences of size $2, 4, 8, ..., p$ and then, with the correct exchanges between
processes, make bigger bitonic sequences. So our first step is to create bitonic sequences using 2 processes each time.
In order to do that, we will locally sort the processes in ascending/descending order using \texttt{quickSort (qsort)}.
This step is quite costly but it is necessary for the algorithm and we will only do it once.

Now we can start the communications between the processes. Each process will keep either the \texttt{min} or
\texttt{max} elements element wise. Once this finishes, every process (block) will be a bitonic sequence, so we can sort 
them locally in O(n) time by applying the \texttt{elbowSort} algorithm explained in detail later on.

We repeat this process but now we initally communicate with the neighbors of distance 2, and then with 
the neighbors of distance 1. The sorting always takes place right after we communicate with the closest neighbor.
In total, this process is repeated $\log_2{p}$ times, and each time we double the initial distance. 
This is clearly visible in Figure \ref{fig:bitonic-sort-network}, where the total steps are equal to $\log_2{8} = 3$.

Finally, we end up with $p$ processes sorted in ascending order, and if we merge them together we get a fully
sorted array of size $p * 2^q$.

\subsection{Hypercube model}

Finding the right neighbor to exchange data with in each stage of the algorithm can be quite tricky. One possible way
is to leverage the power of the hypercube model. First, we give each process a unique $log_2{p}$ bit id. In the case
of 8 processes, each process will have a 3 bit id, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:hypercube-model}. In order to find the right neighbor, all we
need to do is compute $$pid \oplus distance$$ where $\oplus$ is the XOR (exclusive-OR) operator and $pid$ the process id.
